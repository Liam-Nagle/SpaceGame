 # SpaceGame

This game was made as my dissertation piece. The idea of the game is to be an idle game allowing people to gather and gain resources in space. Selling the resources on for a profit and therefore creating more and more resources and gathering more and more money. The game itself is only locally singleplayer. There are many options and ways this game could be improved in the future. Adding in proper sprites and images to make the game more appealing. Aswell as adding in the potential for things such as a prestige system to make the game have more depth. Also adding a multiplayer aspect to make the game competitive and have something to strive towards.
